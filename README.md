# Overview

I choose to do the assignment using Laravel which is a rapid application development PHP framework,
I will not be using all of it's functionality since the framework is extremely vast.
I will use Laravel to provide me with easy REST service setup and to serve a single page application in the form of AngularJS.

### Project Configuration

1. Composer Install

        $ composer install

1. Install Node dependencies.

        $ npm install

1. Build Sources

        $ gulp

> If there are any issues running gulp ensure that you have browserify and gulp install globally
```sh
$ npm install gulp -g
$ npm install browserify -g
```

4. Start up Laravel Dev Server

```sh
$ php artisan serve
```
